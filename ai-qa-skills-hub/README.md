This project is a centralized repository for managing and executing Software QA skills using AI CLIs (Kimi, Claude, etc.).

## Project Structure

- `skills/`: Contains modular QA skills.
  - `test-case-design/`: Prompts and templates for generating test cases.
  - `bug-analysis/`: Skills for root cause analysis and reproduction.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have the necessary AI CLIs installed (e.g., `kimi-cli`, `claude-code-cli`).
2. Explore the `skills/` directory to find the task you want to perform.
3. Use the templates in `prompts/` to build your commands.
