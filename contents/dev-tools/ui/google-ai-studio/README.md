# Google AI Studio

Google AI Studio is a development environment for prototyping and testing generative AI models, particularly useful for creating UI designs and prototypes with AI assistance.

## Features
- Experiment with Google's Gemini models
- Create and test AI prompts
- Fine-tune model behaviors
- API key management
- Prompt iteration and testing

## Getting Started
1. Visit https://aistudio.google.com/
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Choose a model to work with (Gemini Pro, etc.)
4. Start experimenting with prompts
5. Test different UI generation approaches

## UI Generation Capabilities
- Describe UI layouts in natural language
- Generate design concepts
- Create mockups from text descriptions
- Iterate on design ideas quickly
- Export design specifications

## Best Practices
- Start with clear, detailed prompts
- Experiment with different model parameters
- Save successful prompt iterations
- Test variations to explore design space
- Integrate with other design tools

## Use Cases
- UI concept generation
- Design system exploration
- Accessibility testing
- Responsive layout creation
- Content generation for UIs

## Limitations
- Primarily text-based interaction
- Requires Google account
- Model availability varies by region
- May require significant prompt refinement
